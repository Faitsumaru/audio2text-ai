# **_LLM Audio Transcriber_**

## About
This project demonstrates an AI-powered audio-to-text transcription system.  
It leverages modern **Speech Recognition** techniques and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models to automatically convert `.mp3` (or other audio formats) into clean and structured `.txt` files.  

The goal of this project is to provide a simple, extensible, and production-ready pipeline for transcribing audio data into text â€” useful for podcasts, lectures, interviews, and meeting notes.

### Key Features
* **Audio Support** : Works with `.mp3` (extendable to `.wav`, `.flac`, etc.).
* **Transcription Engine** : Based on state-of-the-art speech recognition and optionally enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs) for better text cleaning and formatting.
* **Text Output** : Generates structured `.txt` transcripts, ready for further NLP tasks (summarization, keyword extraction, sentiment analysis).
* **Customizable** : Easy to integrate with other AI/NLP pipelines.
* **CLI & Script Usage** : Run directly from the command line or import as a Python module.

## Project Structure

### Code Overview
1. **Audio Preprocessing** :
   * Input `.mp3` files are converted into a standard format.
   * Audio is normalized and prepared for transcription.
2. **Transcription Engine** :
   * Speech-to-Text model converts audio into raw transcripts.
   * Optional: Post-processing with LLM to improve readability and grammar.
3. **Output Handling** :
   * Results are saved as `.txt` files with proper formatting.
   * Can be extended to export JSON/CSV for structured use.
